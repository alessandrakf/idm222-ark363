    <p>Can I just start by saying that Amsterdam is one of the most interesting places I’ve ever been?! The city is the capital of the Netherlands and has many unique attributes, including museums such as the <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/" target="_blank">Anne Frank House</a> and the <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en" target="_blank">Van Gogh Museum</a>. Besides the more traditional attractions, Amsterdam is home to the Red Light District (do your own research there – haha), coffeeshops (where you can legally buy weed), LOTS of bikes, and stunning canals.</p>
    <p>I stayed in Amsterdam for 4 nights, from a Thursday night to a Monday morning, giving me 3 full days to experience the city. In this post, I am going to describe all of the food and drink spots I got to try while there.</p>

    <h2 id="amsterdam-brunch">Brunch</h2>
    <p>Remember when I said I only had 3 full days in Amsterdam? Well I made GOOD use out of those 3 days and ate brunch each one. They were all very different from each other, so I have categorized them below.</p>

    <br>

    <h3><a href="https://www.theavocadoshow.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Healthier Option:</i> The Avocado Show</a></h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.theavocadoshow.com/" target="_blank">The Avocado Show</a> is as aesthetically pleasing as it is delicious! As you may have guessed, everything on the menu incorporates avocado in one way or another. For example, their burgers are served on an avocado instead of a bun, and their benedicts are on top of an avocado. They have a variety of different menu items, including fries, salads, toasts, poke, burgers, and pancakes. This is a great place to try if you are looking to eat on the healthier side!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://reallyniceplace.com/" target="_blank"><i>The Fun Option:</i> Gs</a></h3>
    <p>Brunch at <a href="https://reallyniceplace.com/" target="_blank">Gs</a> was not only absolutely delectable, but it was a popping spot! Whoever was on their aux was playing modern, enjoyable music that could get any party going. It is known for their extensive Bloody Mary list, including something for just about anyone. Their food items were what you would expect out of any brunch spot, but the taste was incredible! I do not have a single complaint about any of the dishes my table received. I ate the fried chicken and waffles, and my table shared the challah French toast – both were amazing. If you are looking for a boozy brunch, then Gs is the one for you!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.moakpancakes.nl/" target="_blank"><i>The Pancake Option:</i> Moak</a></h3>
    <p>Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes… Did I mention pancakes?! Besides a small section of yogurt bowls and salads, this Moak is primarily focused on pancakes. Their cakes are 100% sugar free and made with organic whole wheat flour and organic buttermilk. They also have a handful of vegan pancake options that look to die for! They have more traditional options, such as pancakes with berries or chocolate chips, and then they also have options that include toppings you would not think to have with your pancakes! For example, the Pink Lady dish features smoked salmon, crème fraiche, avocado, pink peppercorn, dill, and olive oil. When I visited, I was not in the mood for anything too heavy (but still had to get pancakes obviously), so I ordered the Blue Magic Deluxe, which was pancakes with an assortment of yummy and fresh berries. If you are an avid pancake-eater, I definitely suggest stopping here during your Amsterdam visit!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.cafe-del-mar.nl/cms/index.php" target="_blank">Café Del Mar Koffie</a></h3>
    <p>I only visited one café while in Amsterdam: <a href="https://www.cafe-del-mar.nl/cms/index.php" target="_blank">Café Del Mar Koffie</a>. It is the most adorable, bright and relaxing place to go and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. They do not allow laptops and want their customers to enjoy their moment. In the center of the café was a window on the ground showing the basement where they make the coffee fresh. There were lots of drinks treats to choose from to start off your day. Check this place out for your morning coffee and a bite to eat!</p>

    <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://superlyan.com/" target="_blank">Super Lyan</a></h3>
    <p>Look no further for the perfect cocktail spot – <a href="https://superlyan.com/" target="_blank">Super Lyan</a> is it! This is the first international venue from <a href="https://mrlyan.com/" target="_blank">Mr Lyan</a>, who won World’s Best Bar in 2018 and Best Bar in the World in 2017. They have flavorful drinks and amazing foods to either share with the table or eat yourself. Their menu items change throughout the year as they are sure to keep up with the wants and needs of their customers. My group and I enjoyed this spot so much that we went 2 days in a row! It’s that good. If you enjoy a positive ambience with some party music, you should definitely check out Super Lyan.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/shopping/overview-misc-shops/food-hallen" target="_blank">Foodhallen</a></h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/shopping/overview-misc-shops/food-hallen" target="_blank">Foodhallen</a> is an indoor food market that features a wide variety of street food and alcoholic beverages. During my visit, I ate tacos from <a href="https://www.taquerialima.nl/" target="_blank">Taqueria Lima</a> that were everything tacos should be and I got drinks from the bars located throughout. Overall, it was such a fun outing and I cannot recommend going here enough! As you will see from my time in London, I am a huge sucker for food markets. I love the variety of food and drink available at them!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.vansoest-amsterdam.nl/nl/" target="_blank">Van Soest</a></h3>
    <p>I am so glad that I visited <a href="https://www.vansoest-amsterdam.nl/nl/" target="_blank">Van Soest</a>! My group and I had strolled by it and decided to go in, and were welcomed by friendly staff willing to translate all of the products they had. This is the only location full of gourmet chocolates and candies. I ordered just a few pieces of chocolate: dark chocolate, hazelnut praline, and tiramisu. I highly recommend visiting and getting these! Absolutely unreal and the tiramisu was shockingly similar to the real thing!!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/things-to-do/attractions-and-sights/overview-of-attractions/heineken-experience" target="_blank">The Heineken Experience</a></h3>
    <p>Overall I had a good time at the <a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/see-and-do/things-to-do/attractions-and-sights/overview-of-attractions/heineken-experience" target="_blank">Heineken Museum</a>, mainly because you receive some beer with your ticket. If you are extremely interested in the history of Heineken, then this is for you! I personally had little interest in the history of the brand, but was willing to go through the tour. Everything was fine, except midway through you are brought to a huge room that gives you access to a stable with horses. Nothing against the horses but boy did it smell in there! I just was not expecting to endure that smell. There were a lot of opportunities towards the end to take pictures in a photobooth and do other interactive activities, and at the end of the experience, you are brought to their downstairs bar area to enjoy your 2 beers. The experience was fun overall but if we didn’t do the tour I wouldn’t have missed it.</p>

    <h2>Stay</h2>
    <h3><a href="http://www.hotellevell.nl/en" target="_blank">Hotel Levell</a></h3>
    <p>My friends and I stayed at the <a href="http://www.hotellevell.nl/en" target="_blank">Hotel Levell</a>. Since I was studying abroad in London, when planning our travels for the weekends we looked for inexpensive options that were in decent areas, clean, and had good reviews. The hotel was not right in the center of the city, but was an easy 10 minute subway ride to it! The stop was a 2 minute walk from our hotel and could not have been more simple. Our room featured 3 twin beds as there were 3 of us travelling together. It was perfect for us as we did not spend much time in the room. Overall, the bathroom was nice, the room was clean, and it was in a convenient location: I couldn’t have asked for anything better.</p>
