    <p>Barcelona was simply a dream. Up until visiting, I had not fallen so fast and hard in love with a place. I was in constant awe at the beauty and culture of not only the attractions, but the rich history and architecture. The city is home numerous <a href="https://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/gaudi/barcelona-gaudi.html" target="_blank">Gaudí</a> buildings, the most popular being <a href="https://sagradafamilia.org/en/" target="_blank">La Sagrada Familia</a>. Barcelona is also well known for their paella, chocolate and churros, and tapas.  I had an amazing time and will definitely be going back in the (hopefully near) future!</p>
    <p>My friends and I stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights, from late Thursday night to Monday morning. Continue reading if you want to hear about my recommendations for where to eat, see, and stay!</p>

<h2>Where to Eat</h2>
<h3><a href="https://flaxandkale.com/" target="_blank">Flax + Kale</a></h3>
<h4>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch</h4>
<p>If you are on a health kick (which I really hope you aren’t for the duration of your time in Barcelona), than <a href="https://flaxandkale.com/" target="_blank">Flax + Kale</a> is the spot for you! I actually came here twice during my stay, as it was close to where I stayed and had an option for everyone in my group. Their breakfast menu features açai bowls, bowls, toasts, and healthy pancakes, and their drinks include refreshing juices and smoothies.</p>

<h3><a href="https://brunchandcake.com/en/?v=04c19fa1e772" target="_blank">Brunch + Cake</a></h3>
<h4>Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch</h4>
<p>Wow. Just wow. <a href="https://brunchandcake.com/en/?v=04c19fa1e772" target="_blank">Brunch & Cake</a> had a unique menu with cake features in most of the items. If you are looking for an Insta-worthy brunch than look no further. I ate the French toast and my friends and I split the cinnamon bun. I enjoyed both a lot! We were lucky enough to sit outside on a sunny day. We got there early at around 9:00am as I knew that it is super popular. There was already a small line, but since we were so early and agreed to sit outside we were sat quickly. However, by the time we got our food at around 10:00am there was a long line waiting. I would definitely wait again!</p>

<h3><a href="http://tacoalto.es/" target="_blank">Taco Alto</a></h3>
<h4>Lunch, Dinner</h4>
<p>After a long day of walking around Barcelona, <a href="http://tacoalto.es/" target="_blank">Taco Alto</a> had just what my group needed! Located right by the Arc de Triomf, this spot was perfect to fuel us with tacos and mojitos for the rest of our exploring. They have tons of taco options – I got the fish and pork tacos. The mojitos and margaritas were yummy as well and complemented our tacos nicely!</p>

<h3><a href="http://rosanegrarestaurantes.com/" target="_blank">Rosa Negra</a></h3>
<h4>Lunch, Dinner</h4>
<p>For whatever reason, I had an insatiable craving of tacos during this trip. Yes, I know that tacos are originally from Mexico (and I knew this before I travelled to Barcelona) but hey, what can you do. <a href="http://rosanegrarestaurantes.com/" target="_blank">Rosa Negra</a> was a great spot for my group’s second round of tacos for the weekend. This option provided more of a well-rounded Mexican meal opposed to just tacos, which included burritos, quesadillas, and nachos. The drinks were also amazing – I ordered the strawberry mojito and was NOT disappointed. If you have a hankering for tacos during your time in Spain, definitely stop by!</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.txapelarestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Txapela</a></h3>
<h4>Tapas</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.txapelarestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Txapela</a> was a low-key, traditional tapas restaurant. My table ordered a variety of different plates to try, and we shared sangria pitchers. Everything was absolutely amazing! It is a casual restaurant, but compared to other tapas places it was my favorite.</p>

<h3><a href="https://martinezbarcelona.com/en/" target="_blank">Terraza Martinez</a></h3>
<h4>Traditional Paella, Dinner</h4>
    <p>My first paella experience did not disappoint. <a href="https://martinezbarcelona.com/en/" target="_blank">Terraza Martinez</a>’s paella exceeded my expectations. They are located on the mountain of Montjuïc which provides an outstanding view of the city. I ordered the “Señorito Rice”, which is basically the traditional seafood paella, and for dessert I had a warm chocolate cake with ice cream. The restaurant had an upscale ambience, and everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. If you are looking to check out the mountain and want to try paella, I’d recommend stopping here afterwards!</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.chocolat-box.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Chocolat-Box</a></h3>
<h4>Churros + Chocolate, Dessert</h4>
    <p>I unfortunately only had churros and chocolate once during my stay in Barcelona, but <a href="http://www.chocolat-box.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Chocolat-Box</a> made my one and only experience delightful! There are many different places available to try, but my friends and I found this shop while walking around. It was the perfect dessert after a long day!</p>

<h2>What to See</h2>

<h3><a href="https://parkguell.barcelona/en?q=en" target="_blank">Park Güell</a></h3>
    <p><a href="https://parkguell.barcelona/en?q=en" target="_blank">Park Güell</a> was hands down my favorite experience while in Barcelona. The park, created by Antoni Gaudí, features an insane amount of nature and consistently gorgeous architecture. If you want to walk around the entire park, leave a couple of hours for your visit to the park. Also, wear comfortable shoes! Although you are not hiking it, there are a lot of up and down hill areas and I can’t imagine not wearing sneakers while walking it. If you are a runner you may enjoy running the park while you visit!</p>

<h3><a href="https://sagradafamilia.org/en/" target="_blank">Sagrada Familia</a></h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://sagradafamilia.org/en/" target="_blank">Sagrada Familia Church</a> was breathtaking. For those who do not know, the construction of the building began in 1882 and still is not finished. They are currently aiming to have it finished by 2026 as that year will be the 100th anniversary of the Church’s architect Antoni Gaudí’s death. I recommend doing an audio tour as I learned so much from mine about the history of the Church. It was not only extremely interesting to learn, but an insanely gorgeous atmosphere. This is a must-see while in Barcelona!</p>

<h3>Walking Tour of Old City</h3>
    <p>We spent the morning of our first day exploring Barcelona’s <a href="https://www.frommers.com/destinations/barcelona/attractions/the-old-city" target="_blank">Old City</a>. My friend did the research and found the tour, but it was very informative and taught me a lot about the history of Barcelona! It truly is an OLD city, which is the case for most of Europe and is what interested me most during my time abroad since I am from America. It was absolutely glorious walking the streets of Barcelona and taking in the architecture, greenery and sunlight. I highly recommend taking a tour in some form during your time in any city, not just Barcelona!</p>

<h2>Where to Stay</h2>
<p>While in Barcelona I stayed in <a href="https://www.expedia.com/Barcelona-Hotels-Plaza-Goya-Rooms.h1975384.Hotel-Information" target="_blank">Plaza Goya Rooms</a>. As I have mentioned previously on my blog, I was studying abroad in London when coming here, so my friends and I were looking for an inexpensive option but also somewhere easily accessible and clean. This hotel was a perfect match! It is affordable, convenient, and in a great location. Stay here if you are looking for similar features!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to spend another weekend in Barcelona one day… or maybe a week or 2… 😉 Share your favorite spots in Barcelona in the comments below! If you end up trying any of these places I would love to hear about it!</p>
